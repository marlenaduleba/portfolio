This is my portfolio built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. It's where I showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience.

## Technologies Used:

- Next.js: Chosen for its performance and ease of use, supporting both server-side rendering and static generation.
- TypeScript: Utilized for added code clarity and maintainability.
- Tailwind CSS: My preferred styling library for quick and flexible UI development.
- Vercel: Hosting my portfolio on Vercel for seamless deployment and automatic updates from my GitHub repository.
